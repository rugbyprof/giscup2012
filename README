This Visual Studio solution file expects the GIS data to be located in a subfolder with the following structure:

giscup_data\
  WA_EdgeGeometry.txt
  WA_Edges.txt
  WA_Nodes.txt
  GisContestTrainingData\
    input\
      input_01.txt
      input_02.txt
      .
      .
      .
      input_n.txt
    output\
      output_01.txt
      output_02.txt
      .
      .
      .
      output_n.txt

The directory giscup_data\ is at the same level as giscup.sln.

If you are running this program from the command line, then it should be run in the following form:
mapmatch.exe <path to giscup_data>

All files can be downloaded separately from the ACM SIGSPATIAL Cup 2012 website at http://depts.washington.edu/giscup/ .  It is not included in this repository for the sake of space, and will be ignored in the .gitignore file.
